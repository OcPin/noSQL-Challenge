# noSQL-Challenge

Submitted by: Octavio Pinedo

In the first segment of this task, we established our database and adjusted our Jupyter Notebook settings. This involved the incorporation of our Json resource file into MongoDB.

Moving on to Part 2, we expanded our database functionality by introducing a new restaurant and removing establishments that did not pique our interest. Additionally, we converted various fields into numeric formats.

Concluding with Part 3, our emphasis shifted towards exploratory analysis. This phase involved executing diverse queries on the dataset, enabling us to extract valuable insights. These insights helped us address specific inquiries regarding the establishments and their corresponding ratings.
